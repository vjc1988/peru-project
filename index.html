            <h3>Why Peru?</h3>
            <h2>Peru is the third largest country in South America</h2>
            <p>
              Peru is one of the world's most varied countries. It is a
              multicultural nation, filled with traditions, a unique gastronomy
              and vast natural reserves. It is home to 12 UNESCO World Heritage
              Sites and 84 of the planet's 117 life zones. Peru is situated in
              the western part of South America and shares borders with Ecuador,
              Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Chile. Its enormous territory,
              covering more than 1.2 million square kilometers, is composed of
              three regions: Coast, Highlands and Jungle. Its current population
              exceeds 31.5 million inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spanish is the official language of Peru; however, 47 indigenous
              languages are also spoken in the country, including Quechua and
              Aymara.

                <h4>Cusco</h4>
                <p>
                  Formerly the capital of the extensive Inca empire, it retains
                  much of its highly crafted early stone architecture, which is
                  typically preserved in the foundations and lower stories of
                  Spanish colonial structures. Cuzco was designated a UNESCO
                  World Heritage site in 1983.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  One of my favorite things about Cusco and the rest of Peru is
                  the amazing food they have on offer. In recent years the
                  gastronomy is starting to be recognized more and more around
                  the world, and it’s gaining a well-deserved reputation. The
                  food is abundant and full of flavors, some specific to the
                  country. Whether it’s street food or fine dining, it all
                  tastes so good. My favorite foods from Cusco have to be
                  chicharron and lechon, two different ways to prepare pork. I’m
                  also a huge fan of ceviche, from the coast.

                <h4>Nazca Lines</h4>
                <p>
                  The Nazca lines are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of
                  the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. They were created between
                  500 BC and 500 AD by people making depressions or shallow
                  incisions in the desert floor, removing pebbles and leaving
                  different-colored dirt exposed.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  If you love to travel, but don’t love crowds, the Nazca Lines
                  are the perfect destination for you. Over 1.5 million people
                  visit Muchu Picchu ever year, which averages to about 2,500
                  per day, and in 2019 Lima had 2.76 million tourists visit. The
                  Nazca Lines, however, receive far fewer visitors, making them
                  a great less-crowded destination in Peru. The reason why the
                  Nazca lines are famous and visited by people from around the
                  world is because there is so much mystery and many theories on
                  why there were formed.

                <h4>Machu Picchu</h4>
                <p>
                  Machu Picchu , Ancient fortress city of the Incas in the Andes
                  Mountains, south-central Peru. Perched near Cuzco in a narrow
                  saddle between two sharp peaks, at an elevation of 7,710 ft,
                  it escaped detection by the Spaniards. Discovered by Hiram
                  Bingham.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  I’m not the kind of jerk that would leave a one-star review
                  for a UNESCO World Heritage site. Yes, it’s crowded, but I’d
                  never dare to say one of the New 7 Wonders of the World isn’t
                  “worth it”. While there are some brilliant Machu Picchu
                  alternatives, it’s safe to say that there’s nothing exactly
                  like Machu Picchu anywhere else in the world. The citadel
                  sprawls 325 km2 and there are 172 campuses. Machu Picchu is
                  huge and brilliantly restored and loved by many who visit
                  every year.
